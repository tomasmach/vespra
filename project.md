# Mnemon-bot

A Discord bot written in Go that converses using AI and maintains persistent memory about users and topics — per server, with configurable personality and response behavior.

---

## Goals

- AI-powered Discord conversations via OpenRouter
- Persistent memory per server (what was said, by whom, about what)
- Semantic memory recall using vector embeddings
- Configurable response behavior per server/channel
- Per-server personality via `soul.md` files
- Simple single-binary deployment, no daemon, no HTTP API

---

## Language & Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---------|--------|
| Language | Go |
| Discord | `github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo` |
| LLM | OpenRouter (default), via HTTP |
| Database | SQLite via `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` |
| Vector search | Embeddings stored as blobs, cosine similarity in Go |
| Config | TOML via `github.com/BurntSushi/toml` |

## Configuration

Single `config.toml` file, default path `~/.config/mnemon-bot/config.toml`.

```toml
[bot]
token = "..."
soul_file = "~/.config/mnemon-bot/soul.md"   # global fallback

[llm]
openrouter_key = "..."
model = "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"
embedding_model = "openai/text-embedding-3-small"

[memory]
db_path = "~/.local/share/mnemon-bot/mnemon.db"

[agent]
history_limit = 20          # messages kept in-memory per channel
idle_timeout_minutes = 10   # goroutine shuts down after this idle period

[response]
# Global default mode: "smart" | "mention" | "all" | "none"
default_mode = "smart"

# Per-server configuration (overrides global defaults)
[[servers]]
id = "123456789"
soul_file = "~/.config/mnemon-bot/souls/my-server.soul.md"
response_mode = "mention"

[[servers]]
id = "987654321"
# No soul_file — falls back to global soul.md
response_mode = "all"

[tools]
web_search_key = "..."   # optional; web_search tool disabled if absent
```

### Response Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `smart` | AI decides whether the message warrants a response |
| `mention` | Only responds when @mentioned or in a DM |
| `all` | Responds to every message in configured channels |
| `none` | Bot is silent (useful for temporarily disabling) |

---

## soul.md

A markdown file written freely by the user. It becomes the system prompt prefix for all conversations on that server, defining the bot's name, personality, tone, and behavioral guidelines.

Example:
```markdown
You are Mnemon, a thoughtful and curious AI companion on this Discord server.
You remember everything people tell you and bring it up naturally in conversation.
You are warm but not sycophantic. You never pretend to know things you don't.
```

Resolution order: per-server `soul_file` → global `soul_file` → built-in default.

---

## Memory System

### Storage

SQLite database with two tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE memories (
    id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    content     TEXT NOT NULL,
    importance  REAL DEFAULT 0.5,
    server_id   TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id     TEXT,               -- Discord user this memory is about (nullable)
    channel_id  TEXT,
    created_at  DATETIME NOT NULL,
    updated_at  DATETIME NOT NULL,
    forgotten   INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE embeddings (
    memory_id   TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES memories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    vector      BLOB NOT NULL       -- float32 array, little-endian serialized
);

CREATE INDEX idx_memories_server ON memories(server_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_memories_user   ON memories(server_id, user_id);
```

### Scoping

Memories are always scoped to a `server_id`. A bot instance running on multiple servers never mixes their memories. Within a server, memories can optionally be tagged to a specific `user_id`.

### Recall

Hybrid search combining two signals:

1. **Semantic** — cosine similarity between query embedding and stored embeddings
2. **Keyword** — SQLite `LIKE` match on `content`

Results from both are merged and top-N returned (default 10). Forgotten memories are excluded from all searches.

### Embeddings

Generated by calling the configured embedding model via OpenRouter/OpenAI at save time. Stored in the `embeddings` table as serialized `float32` arrays. Never regenerated unless memory content changes.

---

## Agent & Conversation Loop

One goroutine per active Discord channel. Goroutines are created on the first message that passes routing rules and shut down after `idle_timeout_minutes` of no activity.

**Per-turn flow:**

1. Receive Discord message
2. Evaluate response rules (mode + server/channel config)
3. If not responding, return
4. Recall relevant memories via hybrid search on message content
5. Build prompt: `soul.md` system prompt + recalled memories + recent channel history (last N messages)
6. Call OpenRouter with tool definitions
7. Execute any tool calls, feed results back into the loop
8. Repeat until the model produces a plain reply (no tool call)
9. Send reply to Discord

**Conversation history** is kept in-memory per goroutine. It is not persisted — only memories survive restarts.

---

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_save` | Save a fact or observation, tagged with user and importance score |
| `memory_recall` | Search memories by query string, returns top-N matches |
| `memory_forget` | Soft-delete a memory (excluded from future searches, stays in DB) |
| `reply` | Send a text message to the channel |
| `react` | Add an emoji reaction to a message |
| `web_search` | Search the web (disabled if no API key configured) |

---

## Deployment

Single binary, no external services required beyond Discord and OpenRouter.

```
# Build
go build -o mnemon-bot .

# Run
MNEMON_CONFIG=./config.toml ./mnemon-bot
```

Config path resolution order:
1. `MNEMON_CONFIG` environment variable
2. `--config` CLI flag
3. `~/.config/mnemon-bot/config.toml`

---

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly excluded to keep the project small:

- HTTP control API
- Daemon / process management (no start/stop/status commands)
- Cron / scheduled messages
- File ingestion
- Slack / Telegram / other platforms
- Web UI
- Multi-agent routing
